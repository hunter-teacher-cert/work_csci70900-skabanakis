Lesson Objective: 
------------------------------------------------------------
Variables & scanner




Aim: 
------------------------------------------------------------
How are variables important within a program?


Warm up:
------------------------------------------------------------
-Break the students up into groups of 3-4 students.
-Give each group 10 animals and 5 cups.
-Tell them that each item needs a home and they have to name the home of each item.





Lesson Content:
------------------------------------------------------------
-Explain in detail what is a variable and how it hold a value.
-In the warm up the cut was the home to the animals, and some hold 1 anaimal while other could hold more.
-Needless to say that a variable can only hold 1 value.
-Go over how to declare a variable 
- compare variable to algebra where the single letter to words
-Ask them to look at their home name, and have them change the name of the house.
-Have them write out how to declare the variable on paper  using their house names & the 
# of animals in each house. ex: int pen=3;
-(depending on the code you are teaching ) explain the different types of variables you can declare
- for scratch/Hatch you can put all variables in the same block where as in python and java they have to be declared differently
- String,Int, double.
-Then we would walk even deeper on how to assign a new value to that variable.
- Have them take out 1 of the animals from a cup of their choice 
- Then have them write what the new value is and sample how it would be reassigned.
-Go over how to print out the different variables using concatination
-introduce how to import a scanner and store user input into the variable.

Before going on the activity,



Lesson Activity:
------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:

Create a Program called MadLibs. Use a scanner that prompts the user to input at least 3 different types of words. 
Store these words in 3 different variables.
Have the program print/say the three different sentences.
Each sentence must be displayed on seperate pages, if you are using (hatch/scratch)



Closing:
------------------------------------------------------------
Exit ticket:
Have students recap their code in their own words. In addition, to ask any additonal questions that they may have or confusion.
