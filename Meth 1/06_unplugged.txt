Functions Unplugged

Students partner up and each person writes a function for their partner to run through. Use your creativity! Types of functions include: song lyrics, dance, teacher instructions, etc.

For example, one student will write a dance function for their partner to act out each of the dance moves. The function could take in a parameter(s) for how many times certain dance moves are repeated.

The teacher can call functions, and each pair of students performs a different function.
Parameter dictates how many times the move is repeated.

Teacher: 
Call “TikTok dance function” three times
Call “get water” function once
Call “Erase board” function once
Call “write on board” function twice
Etc.
Homework Assignment:  Write a function, and tomorrow you and your partner will act it out.
