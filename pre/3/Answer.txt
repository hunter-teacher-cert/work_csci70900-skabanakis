1. 
No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.

2.
   main
      zoop
        baffle
          ping
		baffle
			ping
	 baffle
		ping

3. If I was to add baffle(); at the end of the ping(); method it would constantly go into a forever loop.  This is because it would constantly go back and forth between the 2 methods and never make it past that.


public static void zoop() {
    baffle(); 3
    System.out.print("You wugga "); 7
    baffle();8
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print("No, I "); 1
    zoop(); 2
    System.out.print("I "); 12
    baffle(); 13
}

public static void baffle() {
    System.out.print("wug"); 4 9 14
    ping(); 5 10 15
}

public static void ping() {
    System.out.println("."); 6 11 16
}
